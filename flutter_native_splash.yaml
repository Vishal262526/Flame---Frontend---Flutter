flutter_native_splash:
  # This package generates native code to customize Flutter's default white native splash screen
  # with background color and splash image.
  # Customize the parameters below, and run the following command in the terminal:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:create
  # To restore Flutter's default white splash screen, run the following command in the terminal:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:remove

  # IMPORTANT NOTE: These parameter do not affect the configuration of Android 12 and later, which
  # handle splash screens differently that prior versions of Android.  Android 12 and later must be
  # configured specifically in the android_12 section below.

  # color or background_image is the only required parameter.  Use color to set the background
  # of your splash screen to a solid color.  Use background_image to set the background of your
  # splash screen to a png image.  This is useful for gradients. The image will be stretch to the
  # size of the app. Only one parameter can be used, color and background_image cannot both be set.
  color: "#8338ec"

  # The image parameter allows you to specify an image used in the splash screen.  It must be a
  # png file and should be sized for 4x pixel density.
  image: assets/images/splash.png

  # The color_dark, background_image_dark, image_dark, branding_dark are parameters that set the background
  # and image when the device is in dark mode. If they are not specified, the app will use the
  # parameters from above.  If there is no parameter above, the app will use the light mode values.
  # If the image_dark parameter is specified, color_dark or background_image_dark must be specified.
  # color_dark and background_image_dark cannot both be set.
  #color_dark: "#042a49"
  #background_image_dark: "assets/dark-background.png"
  # image_dark: assets/splash-invert.png

  android_12:
    image: assets/images/splash.png
    color: "#8338ec"

  # The android, ios and web parameters can be used to disable generating a splash screen on a given
  # platform.
  android: true
  ios: true
